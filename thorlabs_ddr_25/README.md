# NOMAD-CAMELS Driver for Thorlabs Rotation Stage DDR 25

This is a basic driver designed to be able to control the Thorlabs rotation
stage in NOMAD-CAMELS. Its implementation relies on `pylablib`. This integration
does not fully cover the device's capabilities, but it can be used as a base to
develop a more feature-rich driver for this device.
