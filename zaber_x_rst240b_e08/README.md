# NOMAD-CAMELS Driver for Zaber rotation stage RST240B E08

This is a basic driver designed to be able to control the Zaber rotation stage
RST240B E08 in NOMAD-CAMELS. This integration does not fully cover the device's
capabilities, but it can be used as a base to develop a more feature-rich driver
for this device.
