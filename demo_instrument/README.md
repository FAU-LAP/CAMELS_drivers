# NOMAD-CAMELS Driver a Demo Device  

Simulated demo device for testing, written for the measurement software [NOMAD-CAMELS](https://fau-lap.github.io/NOMAD-CAMELS/).

## Features
This instrument simulates a 3-fold axis, where the read values of the detectors all deliver values of a Gaussian peak, depending on the axis' motor-value.  
Configurable are the shape of the Gaussians and noise-values for the detector-readout and motor.
